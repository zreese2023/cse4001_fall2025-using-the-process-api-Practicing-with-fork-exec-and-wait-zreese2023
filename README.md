# Assignment: Practicing the Process API
Practicing with fork, exec, wait. 

### Overview

In this assignment, you will practice using the Process API to create processes and run programs under Linux. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with system calls related to process management. Specifically, you will practice using the unix process API functions 'fork()', 'exec()', 'wait()', and 'exit()'. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is not an OS/161 assignment. You will complete it directly on Linux. 

Use the Linux in your CSE4001 container. If you are using macOS, you may use the Terminal (you may need to install development tools with C/C++ compilers).

### Questions
1. Write a program that calls `fork()`. Before calling `fork()`, have the main process access a variable (e.g., x) and set its value to something (e.g., 100). What value is the variable in the child process? What happens to the variable when both the child and parent change the value of x?


```cpp
// Add your code or answer here. You can also add screenshots showing your program's execution.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main() {
        int value = 23;
        printf("Before fork, value = %d\n", value);
        pid_t pid = fork();

        if (pid < 0) {
                perror("fork failed");
                return 1;
        }
        else if (pid == 0) {
                printf("Child value = %d\n", value);
                value = 100;
                printf("Child changes value = %d\n", value);
        } 
        else {
                printf("Parent value = %d\n", value);
                value = 200;
                printf("Child changes value = %d\n", value);
        }
        return 0
}
```
The child process sees the value of the parent process. When both change it, they are changed independently of each other since they are now separate processes. In my example, the child process
changes the value to 100, and the parent process changes it to 200.


2. Write a program that opens a file (with the `open()` system call) and then calls `fork()` to create a new process. Can both the child and parent access the file descriptor returned by `open()`? What happens when they are writing to the file concurrently, i.e., at the same time?

```cpp
// Add your code or answer here. You can also add screenshots showing your program's execution.

```

3. Write another program using `fork()`.The child process should print ‚Äúhello‚Äù; the parent process should print ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù. You should try to ensure that the child process always prints first; can you do this without calling `wait()` in the parent?

```cpp
// Add your code or answer here. You can also add screenshots showing your program's execution.  
```


4. Write a program that calls `fork()` and then calls some form of `exec()` to run the program `/bin/ls`. See if you can try all of the variants of `exec()`, including (on Linux) `execl()`, `execle()`, `execlp()`, `execv()`, `execvp()`, and `execvpe()`. Why do you think there are so many variants of the same basic call?

```cpp
// Add your code or answer here. You can also add screenshots showing your program's execution.  
```

5. Now write a program that uses `wait()` to wait for the child process to finish in the parent. What does `wait()` return? What happens if you use `wait()` in the child?

```cpp
// Add your code or answer here. You can also add screenshots showing your program's execution.  
```

6. Write a slight modification of the previous program, this time using `waitpid()` instead of `wait()`. When would `waitpid()` be useful?

```cpp
// Add your code or answer here. You can also add screenshots showing your program's execution.  
```

7. Write a program that creates a child process, and then in the child closes standard output (`STDOUT FILENO`). What happens if the child calls `printf()` to print some output after closing the descriptor?

```cpp
// Add your code or answer here. You can also add screenshots showing your program's execution.  
```
